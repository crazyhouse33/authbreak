- Remember to see if doing you own getdelim is not better as some point as I suspect it may be(we can work directely in the internal buffer) and safer as well because not static shared buffer), after performance report per commit routine is in place.

- use https://www.argtable.org/ unstead of argp (cross platform)

change handler constructor to take option type and main component
PROBLEM Iterator Reset to is broken.since we iterate with left pivot, we should start right
BUG investigate ./authbreak -h -s status==0 'echo {/tmp/tata} {/tmp/toto}' that seem to generate bad iteration with files (tested only with it)

redesign stuff so all attacks can take as init a template* and use it:
	template should just be a placeholder carrying informations about content such as charset, max/min len...(ie handler options)
	previous template should be renamed cyclyc_template and should use regular template
	put handlers options stuff at template level

what we want:

placeholder a replacebable region in a string:  DONE

template: a placeholder and informations about content: Nop

cyclic_template: a template that can auto increment himself/reset to given position: Just rename template

handler: generator: Nop, it's a mix of what should be template and cyclic_template

In this sheme every attack get initialized with a list of template, and is free to build cyclic_templates from it, or to just do eratic stuff all the time
