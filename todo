- Remember to see if doing you own getdelim is not better as some point as I suspect it may be(we can work directely in the internal buffer) and safer as well because not static shared buffer), after performance report per commit routine is in place.

change handler constructor to take option type and main component
PROBLEM Iterator Reset to is broken.since we iterate with left pivot, we should start right
BUG investigate ./authbreak -h -s status==0 'echo {/tmp/tata} {/tmp/toto}' that seem to generate bad iteration with files (tested only with it)

redesign stuff so all attacks can take as init templates options and use it unstead of builders:
placeholder a replacebable region in a string:  DONE
template: a placeholder and informations about content: Nop
cyclic_template: a template that can auto increment himself/reset to given position: Just rename template
handler: generator: Nop, it's a mix of what should be template and cyclic_template
